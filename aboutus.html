                    Food allergies aren’t a niche concern—they’re a daily reality for over 33 million Americans, including 1 in 13 children. 
                    The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) classifies food allergies as a disability, yet most hospitality and foodservice 
                    operations still lack the training, protocols, and tools to safely serve this growing population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over 50% of severe allergic reactions occur in foodservice settings, often due to cross-contact, miscommunication, or 
                    lack of staff preparation. When even one member of a group has a food allergy, the entire party will often choose a 
                    different venue—resulting in missed revenue, lost loyalty, and brand damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At <strong>SafetyZone</strong>, we help you lower that risk by making food allergy safety seamless, scalable, 
                    and profitable. Whether you’re running a restaurant, hotel, stadium, campus, or venue—we help you serve more people 
                    safely while building a reputation rooted in trust.
