                        "We had the pleasure of working with Josh from Powers Solutions as our allergy consultant for Quigley’s Café and Smoothie Plus, and we couldn’t be more impressed. From the moment he arrived, Josh was incredibly professional, organized, and well-prepared. 
                        He came in on time, conducted a thorough walkthrough of our operations, and promptly delivered a comprehensive, research-backed document full of detailed suggestions to help us better accommodate customers with allergies and dietary restrictions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Josh’s insights were not only practical and realistic for our operations, but they were also forward-thinking and tailored to our business model. His ideas were supported with market research and revenue projections, making the suggestions easy to implement and understand. He made the process seamless and truly valuable for our team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We’re extremely grateful for the time and care Josh put into his work with us. His professionalism and commitment to helping small businesses stand out through inclusivity and customer care is evident. Highly recommend his services to any food business looking to enhance their allergy and dietary accommodations and overall customer experience."
