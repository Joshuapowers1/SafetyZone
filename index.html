                    <p>
                        SafetyZone founder Joshua Powers has lived with anaphylactic food allergies to dairy, 
                        eggs, and nuts his entire life; an experience deeply shared by his sister, Katherine.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Together, they’ve endured it all: countless emergency room visits, terrifying near-death reactions, and the constant pressure of having to explain, justify, 
                        and defend their needs in a world that too often doesn’t take food allergies seriously.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From an early age, food wasn’t just about nourishment or joy—it was a threat. 
                        Whether at school, in restaurants, or even in hospitals, Joshua and Katherine learned that being safe meant being on guard at all times. The emotional toll of that vigilance—the anxiety, the mistrust, the fatigue—built up over years of living in a system that wasn’t built for them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        They’ve both experienced severe reactions that could’ve ended very differently. And they’ve both faced the same tired responses: “It’s just a preference,” “It’s probably fine,” or “We don’t do that here.” 
                        That constant dismissal is not just frustrating—it’s dangerous.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Joshua founded SafetyZone because he was done waiting for the world to catch up. 
                        Fueled by personal experience and inspired by his sister’s strength, he created a company that doesn’t just acknowledge the allergy community—it protects it. SafetyZone is about making institutions accountable, kitchens safer, and the allergic population finally seen and heard.
